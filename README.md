# Weapon Detection Model on FastAPI

This repository contains a YOLOv8-based model that has been fine-tuned for weapon detection. The model is served using FastAPI, a modern Python web framework, making it easy to deploy and use for real-time weapon detection applications.

## Introduction

The YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once) model is a popular real-time object detection algorithm, and it has been fine-tuned to detect weapons in images and videos. This repository provides a pre-trained model that is ready for use via a FastAPI-based web service.
- This repository is based on the model trained from the code in this repository:
https://github.com/Falcons-ai/weapons_detection_trainer_yolov8_open

## Prerequisites

Before using this repository, you should have the following prerequisites:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- PyTorch
- FastAPI
- OpenCV (for image processing)
- GPU (recommended for real-time performance)

You can install the required Python packages by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Falcons-ai/weapon_detection_fastapi_open
cd weapon_detection_fastapi_open
```

2. Install the requirements:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the FastAPI server:
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

The server will start on `http://localhost:8000`.

## Usage

To use the weapon detection model, you can make POST requests to the FastAPI server. Here is an example using Python requests:

```python
import requests

# Replace with the actual image file path
image_path = "path/to/your/image.jpg"

url = "http://localhost:8000docs#/default/img_object_detection_to_img_detect_weapon_post"
files = {"image": open(image_path, "rb")}
response = requests.post(url, files=files)

if response.status_code == 200:
    result = response.json()
    print("Weapon Detected:", result["weapon_detected"])
    print("Bounding Boxes:", result["bounding_boxes"])
else:
    print("Error:", response.text)
```

## API Documentation

The FastAPI server exposes the following endpoints:

- `POST /default/img_object_detection_to_img_detect_weapon_post`: Upload an image for weapon detection. It returns the detection result, including whether a weapon is detected and bounding boxes.

You can access the interactive API documentation at `http://localhost:8000/docs`.
